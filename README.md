# **FerrisGram**
## **Introduction**
FerrisGram is an asynchronous autogenerated wrapper for the Telegram Bot API written in Rust. This library provides all the methods and types that are available on the official Telegram Bot API.

## **Key Featues**
- **Easy to use**: Heavily inspired by the python-telegram-bot, Ferrisgram is designed in such a way that even a beginner can make a bot with it easily.
- **Asynchronous**: Ferrisgram is powered by rust's built in `await` `async` syntax.  
- **Typo Free Docs**: Autogenerated documentations of the native Bot API types and methods make it typo free.
- **Filters**: Ferrisgram provides filters to make it easy for you to sort different type of updates in a managed way.
